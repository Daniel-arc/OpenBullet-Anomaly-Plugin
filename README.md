**OpenBullet Anomaly Plugin**

A Plugin version of OpenBullet Anomaly Hopefully containing all of the standalone features.. And More!

Installation: Atm the Anomaly plugin isn't suited for a release. With that said all the features are functional and if you want to use it you can compile it yourself. Nuget should take care of any packages you need. 
After building the project place the Anomaly Dll into your plugin folder inside of OpenBullet (v1.2.0 and up) after that create a folder called anomaly inside your Plugin folder and drag all project dependencies inside it.
